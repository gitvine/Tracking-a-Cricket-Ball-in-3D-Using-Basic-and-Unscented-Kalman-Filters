# Tracking-a-Cricket-Ball-in-3D-Using-Basic-and-Unscented-Kalman-Filters
In this project, a Basic Kalman filter and an Unscented Kalman Filter were used to track a cricket ball in three dimensions. 
The ball can bounce off the pitch and can also spin after the bounce. There is one camera to record the ball's position from the top and another 
to record the position from the side. The positions obtained from the cameras have significant measurement errors. 
In the last part of the project, a non-linear ball swing was also introduced to demonstrate the non-linear tracking 
capabilities of the Unscented Kalman Filter.
